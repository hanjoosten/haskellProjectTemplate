# haskellProject

This repository is meant to hold a template to get anyone up to spead with a development environment for [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) projects.


## How to use?

There are two ways that this template could be used, depending on your needs. You could either open it as a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or clone it into a repository of your own and use it in a local vscode environment.

Head over to the [repo](https://github.com/hanjoosten/haskellProject) and click the green button `Use this template`, and make your choice:

### Create a new repository


### Open in a codespace
